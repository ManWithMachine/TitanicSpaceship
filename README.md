Hi guys, this is the competition project from Kaggle.com.

1.Training_one.ipynb contain rules of this project and in this file I processed my train.csv file. In this file you will have comments what I did.  
2.Testing_one.ipynb in this file I did similar steps as with the first one, but here I process test.csv file.  
3.Model_one.ipynb in this file I created four different models, train them and use test data to make my predictions.  
  
Files:  
Transported_lr.csv   
Transported_tf.csv  
Transported_knn.csv  
Transported_rfc.csv   
These are the files that contains my predictions using 4 different models.  

Note:  
Although Random forrest classifier had the best score for training data (Almost 100%), with Tensor flow model I achived best result 0.79!
